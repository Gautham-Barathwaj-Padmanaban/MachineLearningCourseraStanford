SORRY FOR CROSS POSTINGS, IF ANY !

Hello All,
I would like to share information about two NPTEL
courses being offered by me from 14th September 2020 onwards.

A new 12 week course on Introduction to Aircraft Design; preview of
this course is available at:
https://swayam.gov.in/nd1_noc20_ae14/preview

Previous 12 week course on Introduction to Aerospace Engineering is
also being re-run; the preview is available at:
https://swayam.gov.in/nd1_noc20_ae12/preview
Last year, there were ~ 5000 registrations, of which ~ 350 had also
appeared in the final examination.

You are requested to give wide publicity to these two courses, for
which anyone interested can register and attend free-of-cost.

Also, please feel free to contact me via e-mail on <rpant@iitb.ac.in>
for ANY queries related to Aerospace Engineering; I will be happy to
help out as and when time permits !

With best regards,
